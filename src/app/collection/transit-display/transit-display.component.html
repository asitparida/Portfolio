                <p>
                    After three iterations of testing our fidelities, we chose react-native for digital prototyping.
                    The platform was new to us but offered a little bit of familiarity with its use of flex-based
                    layouts.
                    The richer native integrations, like using accelerometer for detecting a shake gesture, has been
                    well-received.
