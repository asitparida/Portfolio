                    Dictionary.com’s word of year for 2018 is “<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year/"

                    "fake" news around us.
                    The propagation of such malicious content can be attributed to our own social circles.

                    The rampant spread of “fake” news is due to people seeking out and believing information which
                    aligns with their currently-held attitudes.
                    We blindly trust the source i.e. a friend of ours who re-tweeted or shared the article from
                    somewhere (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model" target="_blank">ELM</a>).

                    and important characteristics of
                    misinformation, especially in the form of blurbs that are “convenient”, “efficient”, and
