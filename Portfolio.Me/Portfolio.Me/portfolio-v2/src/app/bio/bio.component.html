        <p class="info hidden-on-xs">I have worked closely with UX designers and usability experts to learn the nuances of great user experiences. My
            core skills include developing responsive, adaptive and accessible web and native apps using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript,
            Angular, Knockout JS, Electron etc. I have also managed UI deliveries for the projects. Apart from my work, I
            do spend time exploring new frameworks by building kitchen-sink apps. I do love investing time in the new UI
            development trends, data visualization libraries and developing plugins. My focus has been performance and extensibility
            which has enabled me to contribute and impact across multiple projects. I also have experience building SVG animations
            using GSAP and am comfortable with Photoshop & Illustrator. Apart from my core skills, I am a full-stack developer
            with experience in developing back-ends with .NET and SQL Server. </p>
